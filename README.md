## Machine Vision Project

# 🍾 Counting Bottles in a Crate 📦

This MATLAB-based project demonstrates bottle detection in images. Developed as a final home assignment, it employs the Hough Transform technique to locate and count bottles with a series of preprocessing steps to enhance image quality.

## Features 🌟

- Preprocessing functions to improve image quality for detection.
- Hough Transform for robust circle detection representing bottles.
- Interactive results display with a figure showing detected bottles.

## Results 📊

The output includes a table comparing the detected number of bottles against true counts and an interactive visualization of each processed image.
